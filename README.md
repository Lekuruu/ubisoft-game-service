# Ubisoft Game Service

This repository features a re-implementation of Ubisoft's Game Service (GS) network.

The majority of the reverse engineering work that made this possible was done by [michal-kapala](https://github.com/michal-kapala), to which all credit should go to. This project is primarily a rewrite of their work, with the primary goal being to learn go. You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/michal-kapala/gsconnect).
